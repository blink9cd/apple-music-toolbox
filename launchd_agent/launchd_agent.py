"""Install, uninstall and read a user LaunchAgent, each step confirmed by launchd's own answer.

Why this exists
---------------
Every scheduled job that runs under launchd repeats one sequence: write the
plist, boot out any loaded copy, wait until launchd says it is gone, bootstrap the new one, and
wait until launchd says it is loaded. This module is that sequence written once. It decides
nothing about what an agent runs: the caller hands it a label, a plist path and the plist bytes.

``launchctl print`` has three answers, not two: exit 0 is loaded, 113 is absent, and anything
else (a timeout and a missing launchctl included) is unknown. An unknown answer ends a wait at
once with :class:`LaunchdError`; it is never taken for either settled answer, and polling it
would only hide its exit code behind the deadline.

``bootout`` is not instantaneous, so install waits for absent before bootstrapping the same
label, and then waits for loaded whatever bootstrap exited: a bootstrap racing the old
instance's teardown can exit non-zero while launchd goes on to load the agent, so the read-back,
not the exit code, is the confirmation. The plist is written before anything is unloaded, so a
failure never leaves the old agent gone with no plist to retry from. Uninstall removes the plist
only once launchd confirms the agent absent: until then the plist is what a retry needs.

Entry point assumptions
-----------------------
Import-only: no CLI and no output. Every launchctl call goes through the :class:`Launchctl`
handed in, so a test scripts launchd and never reaches it; :func:`real_launchctl` is the one
host seam. The shared libraries it imports are found by a bounded upward search from this
file, which reads only its own folder and the one above it: a sibling folder of the
library's own name, as this repository lays them out, or one under a ``utilities/``
folder beside it.
